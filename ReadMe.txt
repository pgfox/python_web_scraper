A sample project that scrapes the zff website and carries out some small manipulation in pandas. 


script brief discription:
=================================

movie_scraper.py - this is the module that scrapes the archive pages from zff.com.
    e.g https://zff.com/en/archive/?page=1&language=en&festival_year=2011 . This generates ./data/data_zff_src.csv
    You can control what year are being scrapped by modifying FESTIVAL_YEAR_SCRAPE. For this project we need to scrape
     2010 to 2019 (inclusive). It generates ./data/data_zff_src.csv

add_dirt.py -  (artifically) add additional "dirt" to ./data/data_zff_src.csv and creates ./data/data_zff_src_dirty.csv

movie_cleaner.py - cleans ./data/data_zff_src_dirty.csv and generates ./data/data_zff_stage.csv.


Other files and directories:
===========================

./data/year/ - contains the source data scraped from each year

./data/ -  contains the _src.csv, _src_dirty.csv

./data - contains the _stage.csv

./logs/ - the logs that are generated by movie_scraper.py, add_dirt.py and movie_clean.py
